# Libraries
library(tidyverse, verbose = F)
library(knitr)
library(readr)

library(ggplot2)

```

# Wrangling
Creating a fake data set where `obs` is the observed grain protein content (%) and `pred` is the predicted grain protein content (%).  

```{r mydf}
set.seed(156)
mydf <- tibble(x=rnorm(30,10,2)) %>%
  mutate(e=rnorm(30,0,2),
         y=0 + 1*x + e) %>%
  select(obs=x, pred=y)

mydf
```

```{r}
ggplot(mydf, aes(x=obs, y=pred))+
         geom_point(color="blue")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
         geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)+
         labs(x="Observed grain protein content (%)", y="Predicted grain protein content (%)")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min=5, max=15))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min=5, max=15))
  
  
  
```


# To-dos  
## To be done  
Next steps in this workflow would be to:
- Create a nice plot (perhaps scatterplot), with 1:1 line, smooth line, and with points colored.

## Done  
- Included the option `keep_md: true` on the 
YAML (this makes sure that the md file is maintained, so the script can be nicely displayed by GitHub)
