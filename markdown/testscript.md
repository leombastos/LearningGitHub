# Setup

```r
# Libraries
library(tidyverse, verbose = F)
library(knitr)
```

# Wrangling
Creating a fake data set where `obs` is the observed grain protein content (%) and `pred` is the predicted grain protein content (%).  


```r
set.seed(156)
mydf <- tibble(x=rnorm(30,10,2)) %>%
  mutate(e=rnorm(30,0,2),
         y=0 + 1*x + e) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~round(.x, 2))) %>%
  select(obs=x, pred=y)

mydf
```

```
## # A tibble: 30 x 2
##      obs  pred
##    <dbl> <dbl>
##  1  7.15  2.83
##  2  7.61  8.36
##  3 10.4   9.75
##  4  9.97  9.35
##  5 12.8  13.2 
##  6  8.63  7.51
##  7 10.2   8.94
##  8  9.91  8.15
##  9 11.9  14.6 
## 10 11.2  11.2 
## # â€¦ with 20 more rows
```

# To-dos  
## To be done  
Next steps in this workflow would be to:
- Create a nice plot (perhaps scatterplot), with 1:1 line, smooth line, and with points colored.

## Done  
- Included the option `keep_md: true` on the 
YAML (this makes sure that the md file is maintained, so the script can be nicely displayed by GitHub)
