# Exploring GitHub  
This repository serves for collaborators to explore GitHub and learn its implementation for data science projects.  

As we learn new skills, we are writing our progress and notes into a **slide deck** that you can find  
  - in this repo (not rendered), and 
  - its rendered version [here](https://agronomy.netlify.app/slides/02-learngit/githelp.html#1).
